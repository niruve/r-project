# r-project
First project involving R code

In this project I will be calculating and simulating different distributions. This project is done in two tasks. The first task is to simulate distributions by generating random mixtures of uniform and normal distributions, and to answer questions based on the distributions. The second task involves simulating Beta-Binomial distribution, Bayesian inference and Monto Carlo simulation. Answers for task two are written in a report explaining each step taken.
